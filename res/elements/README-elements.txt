This directory for any dynamically-loadable element .so's that live in
the tree but, for whatever reason, aren't built by MFM.

standard ulam element library, and 'libuedemos.so', a bunch of ulam
element demos.  They are built by ULAM but then stuffed in here, so
they're in the MFM distribution and available even if ULAM itself is
not installed on any particular machine.
